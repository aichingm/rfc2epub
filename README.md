rfc2epub - create an epub ebook from an IETF RFC
=================================================

## Usage

 `rfc2epub [-flags [parameter]] <number of the rfc> <output book name>`
 *Checkout the EXAMPLES (with:* `rfc2epub -e`*)*



## Flags  

-e    show usage examples  
-h    print this message  
-f    replace the vendors font with M+ M1 (a very narrow monospaced font by the M+ FONTS PROJECT) 
-d    do not package the book to epub but create the file and directory structure with all its contents  
-t    create a table of contents  


-F    M+ M1 comes in thin, light, regular and medium (see example 2)  
-L    set the letter-spacing (use positive or negative values - example 3)  
-S    set the text which splits the text and the page number in the  
      table of contents  



## Examples

1. `rfc2epub 2549 2549.epub`
  Creates an ebook of the rfc 2549 and names it 2549.epub 

2. `rfc2epub -fF light 2549 2549.epub`
  The `f` flag replaces the vendors font with the M+ 1M font.
  The patameter for `F` will be set to light.

3. `rfc2epub -fFL regular -1 2549 2549.epub`
  The `f` flag replaces the vendors font with the M+ 1M font.
  The patameter for `F` will be set to regular.
  The parameter for `L` will be set to -1 to narrow the letters. This is
  useful if 80 characters per line do not fit on your epub readers screen.
